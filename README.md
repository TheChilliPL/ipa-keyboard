# IPA Keyboard

This repository contains a keyboard layout allowing you to input the International Phonetic Alphabet easily. It's heavily based on X-SAMPA, so knowing X-SAMPA, you should be able to learn to use it quickly.

The keyboard layout is made in Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator 1.4 and works in Windows 11.

The language code is set to Icelandic, so that it shows ISL in the language bar.
